All dependencies were reviewed, and the Go-Live date was updated...""  2.  **Were CSAT survey guidelines followed (survey name + customer contact)?**     *   **Coverage:** Fully Present     *   **Score:** 1     *   **Explanation:** ""The CSAT survey for the phase-1 delivery was launched last week, titled ""HRMS Phase 1 Feedback"". The customer contact (Mr. Naveen Nair, HR Ops Head) has confirmed receipt...""  3.  **Was EPS tool used for design justification or documentation?**     *   **Coverage:** Fully Present     *   **Score:** 1     *   **Explanation:** ""During the same session, the EPS tool was used to document the field-level mapping and architecture flow... The design document includes rationale for optional components excluded...""  4.  **Was a Planning & Design call conducted, and were status/notes shared?**     *   **Coverage:** Fully Present     *   **Score:** 1     *   **Explanation:** ""We conducted a joint Planning & Design session... Follow-up actions from the call were assigned, including adjustments... These are being tracked in the JIRA sprint board.""  5.  **Were post-deployment checks completed (EPS lifecycle closure)?**     *   **Coverage:** Fully Present     *   **Score:** 1     *   **Explanation:** ""post-deployment checks were initiated after the staging cutover. The EPS lifecycle tracking page now reflects 100% test completion and handoff acceptance. All validations... have passed QA.""  6.  **Was formal closure communication sent to the customer (SCN/CAF)?**     *   **Coverage:** Partially Addressed     *   **Score:** 0.5     *   **Explanation:** The document mentions ""working on archiving all closure documents from phase-0 and ensuring that our SCN and CAF compliance is up to date for upcoming closure cycles"" and ""Prepare SCN package for Phase 1 closure"" in Next Steps. This indicates awareness and preparation for closure, but not confirmation that formal communication has been *sent* for the current (Phase 1) project closure.  7.  **Was the customer kick-off meeting conducted and documented?**     *   **Coverage:** Fully Present     *   **Score:** 1     *   **Explanation:** ""The kick-off session conducted in April helped establish key communication flows...

This ensures the full lifecycle step is verified as completed."
pm_partial_5of10_compliance.pdf,0.0,Needs Improvement,"Here's the assessment of the PM document against the compliance parameters:  ---  **Evaluation Checklist Assessment:**  1.  **Is CRD updated and in sync with milestone data?**     *   **Status:** Partially Addressed     *   **Score:** 0.5     *   **Explanation:** ""Milestone tracking is accurate within the dev board"" implies milestone data is being tracked, but ""CRD"" (Change Request Document or similar repository) is not explicitly mentioned, nor is a direct sync. ""Dev board"" is assumed to be the system of record.  2.  **Were CSAT survey guidelines followed (survey name + customer contact)?**     *   **Status:** Partially Addressed     *   **Score:** 0.5     *   **Explanation:** The CSAT survey is ""under preparation"" and a ""tentative name"" is finalized, but it hasn't gone out yet. There's no mention of specific customer contacts being identified per guidelines, only internal tracking.  3.  **Was EPS tool used for design justification or documentation?**     *   **Status:** Fully Present     *   **Score:** 1     *   **Explanation:** ""prior design artifacts [EPS] were referenced again by QA to review the structure..."" This confirms that EPS design outputs were used for review, implying their role in documentation/justification.  4.  **Was a Planning & Design call conducted, and were status/notes shared?**     *   **Status:** Fully Present     *   **Score:** 1     *   **Explanation:** ""We had a joint session with design and development last week... Meeting notes were captured and stored in the Sprint 6 folder on SharePoint.""  5.  **Were post-deployment checks completed (EPS lifecycle closure)?**     *   **Status:** Partially Addressed     *   **Score:** 0.5     *   **Explanation:** ""CSAT survey... will likely go out once campaign batch #2 is validated post-deployment"" suggests post-deployment validation is planned/ongoing. ""Track pending EPS migration cleanup"" implies post-deployment activity. However, it doesn't confirm completion of formal checks or EPS lifecycle closure.  6.  **Was formal closure communication sent to the customer (SCN/CAF)?**     *   **Status:** Missing     *   **Score:** 0     *   **Explanation:** Explicitly states, ""There's been no communication on the SCN or closure mail.""  7.  **Was the customer kick-off meeting conducted and documented?**     *   **Status:** Missing     *   **Score:** 0     *   **Explanation:** The document mentions ""project scope was well-understood back then"" and ""not had any joint syncs with the client stakeholders"" since, but provides no evidence or documentation of an initial customer kick-off meeting.  8.  **Is there a high-level project plan or schedule in an acceptable format?**     *   **Status:** Partially Addressed     *   **Score:** 0.5     *   **Explanation:** ""Milestone tracking is accurate within the dev board"" and ""The final handover is expected by July 20"" imply the existence of a schedule/plan, but there's no direct confirmation of a ""high-level project plan"" in an ""acceptable format.""  9.  **Were risks/issues logged and communicated proactively?**     *   **Status:** Missing     *   **Score:** 0     *   **Explanation:** Several issues are identified (planning call ran long, client-side impact not evaluated, resource ramp-up paused, lack of external collaboration), but there's no indication that these were formally *logged* in a risk/issue register or *communicated proactively* to stakeholders as formal risks/issues.  ---  **Total Score out of 9:** 4  **Compliance Status:** Needs Improvement  **Suggested Key Improvement Points:**  1.  **Strengthen Customer Engagement and Formal Communication:** Implement mandatory procedures for formal customer kick-off meetings (with documentation), regular stakeholder syncs, and official project closure communications (SCN/CAF). This is a significant gap affecting overall project visibility and trust. 2.  **Establish Robust Risk & Issue Management:** Develop and utilize a formal process and tool for logging, tracking, and proactively communicating all identified risks and issues to relevant internal and external stakeholders, ensuring timely resolution and transparency. 3.  **Formalize Post-Deployment and Closure Processes:** Define clear, repeatable steps for post-deployment checks, EPS lifecycle closure, and CSAT survey execution, including adherence to guidelines for customer contact lists and official dispatch."
