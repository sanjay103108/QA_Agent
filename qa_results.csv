pm_detailed_fully_compliant.pdf,0.0,Compliant,"Here's the assessment of the PM document based on the provided context snippets:  ---  **Evaluation Checklist Results:**  1.  **Is CRD updated and in sync with milestone data?**     *   **Status:** Fully Present     *   **Score:** 1     *   **Explanation:** The document states, ""The team finalized the CRD update last Thursday and ensured its alignment with our revised milestone plan. All dependencies were reviewed, and the Go-Live date was updated to reflect the impact of the recent infrastructure delay.""  2.  **Were CSAT survey guidelines followed (survey name + customer contact)?**     *   **Status:** Fully Present     *   **Score:** 1     *   **Explanation:** ""The CSAT survey for the phase-1 delivery was launched last week, titled 'HRMS Phase 1 Feedback'. The customer contact (Mr. Naveen Nair, HR Ops Head) has confirmed receipt...""  3.  **Was EPS tool used for design justification or documentation?**     *   **Status:** Fully Present     *   **Score:** 1     *   **Explanation:** ""During the same session, the EPS tool was used to document the field-level mapping and architecture flow for the core attendance module. The design document includes rationale for optional components excluded...""  4.  **Was a Planning & Design call conducted, and were status/notes shared?**     *   **Status:** Fully Present     *   **Score:** 1     *   **Explanation:** ""We conducted a joint Planning & Design session... Follow-up actions from the call were assigned, including adjustments... These are being tracked in the JIRA sprint board."" The assignment and tracking imply that status/notes were shared and acted upon.  5.  **Were post-deployment checks completed (EPS lifecycle closure)?**     *   **Status:** Fully Present     *   **Score:** 1     *   **Explanation:** ""As part of our standard protocol, post-deployment checks were initiated after the staging cutover. The EPS lifecycle tracking page now reflects 100% test completion and handoff acceptance. All validations... have passed QA.""  6.  **Was formal closure communication sent to the customer (SCN/CAF)?**     *   **Status:** Partially Addressed     *   **Score:** 0.5     *   **Explanation:** The document mentions, ""...ensuring that our SCN and CAF compliance is up to date for upcoming closure cycles."" and ""Prepare SCN package for Phase 1 closure."" This indicates preparation and future intent, but not that the formal closure communication for the *current* phase has already been sent to the customer.  7.  **Was the customer kick-off meeting conducted and documented?**     *   **Status:** Fully Present     *   **Score:** 1     *   **Explanation:** ""The kick-off session conducted in April helped establish key communication flows and escalation paths. All meeting summaries are available on Teams.""  8.  **Is there a high-level project plan or schedule in an acceptable format?**     *   **Status:** Fully Present     *   **Score:** 1     *   **Explanation:** The document refers to an ""approved roadmap"" and states, ""the new schedule has been uploaded to the central tracker and circulated during the weekly stand-up,"" implying a formal, accessible plan.  9.  **Were risks/issues logged and communicated proactively?**     *   **Status:** Fully Present     *   **Score:** 1     *   **Explanation:** ""Risk-wise, a red flag was raised earlier this week... A mitigation plan has been documented... Issue tracker has been updated, and the client PM has acknowledged the plan.""  ---  **Total Score:** 8.5 / 9  **Compliance Status:** Compliant  ---  **Key Improvement Points:**  1.  **Formal Closure Confirmation:** While the SCN package for Phase 1 closure is being prepared, ensure explicit confirmation that this formal closure communication has been *sent* to the customer for the completed phase. This would fully close the loop on project completion. 2.  **Documentation Traceability:** For certain items like Planning & Design call notes, while follow-up actions imply documentation, explicitly referencing a central repository (e.g., ""Meeting minutes and design decisions are archived in SharePoint"") can further enhance traceability for audit purposes."
pm_partial_5of10_compliance.pdf,0.0,Needs Improvement,"Here is the assessment of the PM document based on the provided context snippets:  ---  **Evaluation Checklist Assessment:**  1.  **Is CRD updated and in sync with milestone data?**     *   **Status:** Missing     *   **Score:** 0     *   **Explanation:** ""CRD"" (Client/Customer Requirements Document) is not mentioned anywhere in the provided context. While ""Milestone tracking is accurate within the dev board"" is noted, its synchronization with an unmentioned CRD cannot be confirmed.  2.  **Were CSAT survey guidelines followed (survey name + customer contact)?**     *   **Status:** Partially Addressed     *   **Score:** 0.5     *   **Explanation:** The document mentions ""The name is tentatively ""MA Release Feedback"""" for the survey. However, there's no detail on whether customer contact guidelines were followed, only that it ""will likely go out"" and an ""internal tracking sheet"" is finalized.  3.  **Was EPS tool used for design justification or documentation?**     *   **Status:** Fully Present     *   **Score:** 1     *   **Explanation:** The context explicitly states, ""prior design artifacts were referenced again by QA to review the structure..."" and also mentions ""Track pending EPS migration cleanup,"" indicating EPS was integral to design and ongoing activities.  4.  **Was a Planning & Design call conducted, and were status/notes shared?**     *   **Status:** Fully Present     *   **Score:** 1     *   **Explanation:** ""We had a joint session with design and development last week... The planning call ran long... Meeting notes were captured and stored in the Sprint 6 folder on SharePoint."" This confirms the call and note-sharing.  5.  **Were post-deployment checks completed (EPS lifecycle closure)?**     *   **Status:** Missing     *   **Score:** 0     *   **Explanation:** The document mentions ""Track pending EPS migration cleanup,"" indicating that EPS lifecycle closure activities are still outstanding, not completed.  6.  **Was formal closure communication sent to the customer (SCN/CAF)?**     *   **Status:** Missing     *   **Score:** 0     *   **Explanation:** The context explicitly states, ""There's been no communication on the SCN or closure mail."" It also indicates ""Review SCN and CAF planning timelines"" as a next step, confirming they are not yet sent.  7.  **Was the customer kick-off meeting conducted and documented?**     *   **Status:** Missing     *   **Score:** 0     *   **Explanation:** While ""project scope was well-understood back then"" implies some initial interaction, there is no explicit mention or documentation of a formal ""customer kick-off meeting.""  8.  **Is there a high-level project plan or schedule in an acceptable format?**     *   **Status:** Partially Addressed     *   **Score:** 0.5     *   **Explanation:** ""Milestone tracking is accurate within the dev board"" and ""The final handover is expected by July 20"" suggest some form of schedule exists. However, there's no confirmation of a comprehensive ""high-level project plan"" or its format.  9.  **Were risks/issues logged and communicated proactively?**     *   **Status:** Partially Addressed     *   **Score:** 0.5     *   **Explanation:** Several issues/risks are identified internally (e.g., ""planning call ran long due to differences,"" ""resource ramp-up plan was paused,"" ""collaboration with external customer teams must increase""). This shows awareness. However, explicit confirmation of formal logging (e.g., in a risk register) or proactive *external* communication is lacking. The statement ""Client-side impact hasn't yet been evaluated"" points to a gap in proactive communication for some risks.  ---  **Total Score out of 9:** 0 + 0.5 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0.5 + 0.5 = **3.5 / 9**  **Compliance Status:** **Needs Improvement** (Score below 5)  **Key Improvement Points:**  1.  **Strengthen Foundational Planning & Documentation:** Critical project artifacts like the CRD and formal kick-off meeting documentation are missing. Establish and maintain these foundational documents to ensure clear scope, requirements, and stakeholder alignment from project inception. 2.  **Implement Robust Project Closure Procedures:** There's a significant gap in formal project closure, including post-deployment checks and customer communication (SCN/CAF). Develop and strictly adhere to a comprehensive closure checklist to ensure all technical and contractual obligations are met and formally acknowledged. 3.  **Formalize Risk & Issue Management:** While issues are identified, there's no clear evidence of a formal logging process or proactive communication, especially externally. Implement a structured risk and issue management plan that includes logging, tracking, mitigation strategies, and transparent communication to all relevant stakeholders."
